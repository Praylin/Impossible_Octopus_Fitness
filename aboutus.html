							<p> We are the students from Holberton School working on the project "Impossible Octopus Fitness".  In impossible octopus fitness, we are trying to create a twitter clone, which we started from the scratch. Impossible octopus fitness is a project which is done with basic HTML and CSS. Another aim of impossible octopus fitness is to apply some search engine optimization techniques in this website to increase the ranking. The entire budget of Impossible octopus fitness is $0.</p>
							<p>An octopus is a cephalopod mollusc of the order Octopoda. It has two eyes and four pairs of arms and, like other cephalopods, it is bilaterally symmetric. An octopus has a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the arms. An octopus has no internal or external skeleton allowing it to squeeze through tight places.Octopuses are among the most intelligent and behaviorally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>
							<p>Octopuses inhabit diverse regions of the ocean, including coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the ocean floor. They have numerous strategies for defending themselves against predators, including the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and deimatic displays, their ability to jet quickly through the water, and their ability to hide. An octopus trails its eight arms behind it as it swims. All octopuses are venomous, but only one group, the blue-ringed octopus, is known to be deadly to humans.</p>
